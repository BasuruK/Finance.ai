# Security Audit Report - Financial Services Project

## Date: September 8, 2025

## Summary
Critical malware vulnerabilities were detected and addressed in the project dependencies.

## Issues Found
The following packages contained malware:
- **color-convert**: Malware detected (GHSA-ch7m-m9rf-8gvv)
- **color-name**: Malware detected (GHSA-m99c-cfww-cxqx)  
- **debug**: Malware detected (GHSA-8mgj-vmr8-frr6)
- **is-arrayish**: Malware detected (GHSA-hfm8-9jrf-7g9w)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate Response
- Removed ESLint and related packages temporarily to eliminate most malware sources
- Updated Next.js to latest version (15.5.2) 
- Added package overrides and resolutions to force safe versions

### 2. Package Overrides Applied
```json
"overrides": {
  "color-convert": "2.0.1",
  "color-name": "1.1.4", 
  "debug": "4.3.4",
  "is-arrayish": "0.3.2",
  "color": "4.2.3",
  "color-string": "1.9.1",
  "simple-swizzle": "0.2.2"
}
```

### 3. Current Status
- ✅ Application builds successfully
- ✅ Development server runs without issues
- ⚠️ Some audit warnings remain from Next.js dependencies (non-critical)
- ✅ Core functionality preserved

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Continue monitoring**: Run `npm audit` regularly
2. **Avoid force installs**: Only use when absolutely necessary
3. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regular maintenance schedule

### Long Term
1. **Implement security scanning**: Add automated security checks to CI/CD
2. **Dependency pinning**: Consider exact versions for critical packages
3. **Alternative packages**: Evaluate alternatives to problematic dependencies
4. **Security policies**: Establish clear guidelines for dependency management

## Notes
- ESLint was temporarily removed to eliminate malware vectors
- The application remains fully functional
- React 19 compatibility maintained with Next.js 15
- Package overrides successfully prevent malware installation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor for updates to the affected packages
2. Re-evaluate ESLint installation when safe versions are available
3. Consider implementing dependency security scanning tools
4. Regular security audits (monthly recommended)
